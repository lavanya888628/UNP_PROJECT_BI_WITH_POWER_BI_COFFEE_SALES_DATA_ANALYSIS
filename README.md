# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COFFEE_SALES_DATA_ANALYSIS

 I completed a Coffee Sales Data Analysis project in collaboration with UNP using real-world coffee sales data. The project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing coffee sales data using Microsoft Power BI. I developed an interactive dashboard to examine key factors influencing sales performance such as total revenue, product category, time of day, monthly trends, and weekday distribution. The report highlights important metrics including total revenue, average sales, peak and non-peak hour revenue. Interactive visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, and slicers were used to generate meaningful business insights. The dashboard helps identify top-performing products and sales patterns contributing to revenue growth. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design while enabling data-driven decision-making to improve overall sales performance.
